      <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
      <p id="web-security-answer">
        It is important to secure your web site to prevent it from being attacked. I would recommend to include everybody in security practices, so that they all are aware of the security threats and risks. 
        I would recommend configuring your web server to use HTTPS with an SSL certificate. This means that the communication between the website (server) and the browser is encrypted. This way you keep private, and sensitive information protected. <br><br>
        Only store and display data that you need. For example, if a credit card number is to be stored, only display the last few digits. Automatic user timeout can also be implemented to protect users who have left their credentials hanging in the browser for a long time. <br><br>
        It is important to use strong passwords and change them often. I would also consider two factor authentication.
        Regularly update the web site to protect it from hackers. If you get hacked, then you got a backup to reinstall the web site.  
        Use vulnerability scanning tools to perform automated security testing on the web site to find and fix issues like SQL-injections or cross-site scripting.
